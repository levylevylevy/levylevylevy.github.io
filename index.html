										<p>
											I'm a second year Computer Engineering honors student at Northeastern University in Boston. Before college, I attended LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts in NYC, where I studied Visual Arts. My experiences there sparked my love for design, and I now try to program and create the best technical experience through the lense of a creative. I am hoping to leverage these skills in the product development field, while I learn more about my tech passions: engineering design, prototyping, game development, interaction technology, AR/VR, 3D rendering and design, data visualization, human-computer interaction, computer vision, accessibility engineering, and security. Within my work, I prioritize creativity, determination, attention to detail, collaboration, and an open-minded curiousity. Head over to the Education and Experience tab to learn more about my path so far, or the Portfolio tab to view my projects!
										</p>
                                        <p>
											Besides working with technology, I love to draw and make up stories. I am constantly doodling! Currently, I am exploring this by running/DM-ing a Dungeons and Dragons campaign with a few friends. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
I also love exploring others’ stories, whether through books, movies and shows, artwork, video games, or music! My favorite genres are fantasy, sci-fi, and adventure, so I’m currently playing The Witcher and Skyrim. 
                                                        </p>

                                                                                            <p>

Besides this, I love animals. Some of my favorite memories include the high school summers where I volunteered at a cat rescue. I have a super cute cat named Kitty!
        </p>

<p>

I enjoy trying new things, like baking (or failing at baking), or meeting new people. Feel free to reach out about any opportunities, or even to just chat!

											LaGuardia High School was truly a unique experience that has since shaped my outlook on product design!

											The Congressional App Challenge is the US House of Representatives' national computer science competition. In 2018 I submitted a project and won, and in 2019 I applied for and was accepted to be on the Alumni Advisory Board. I oversaw 6 ambassadors across the nation as they worked on outreach and promoting the challenge. This included setting up meetings, and creating and managing a Google Drive folder for their materials. I also had quarterly meetings in which I communicated progress with my bosses. Within our outreach, we focused on further diversifying the competition, and that year the Challenge recruited more students from underrepresented backgrounds in CS than ever before! Some of the stats we were proud of included that 1 in 3 App Challenges were held in large rural areas, and that compared to Silicon Valley, App participants were 4x likely to identify as black, 5x likely to identify as latinx, and 2x likely to identify as female!
